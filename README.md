CRUD App for GA Unit 2 Project

Description
Stitches by Moonlight is an app that allows you to document distinctly non grandma-like usage for stitches as you learn them.

Using the Stitches by Moonlight App
A user can enter a photo url, stitch name, skill level, and type, as well as notes on the stitch usage.

Technologies Used
Stitches by Moonlight was built using HTML, CSS, Mongoose, MongoDB, and was deployed on Heroku.

Approach
I knew I wanted to basically create an app that allowed for collecting. I do embroidery for fun and this seemed like a good way
to document the types of stitches I've learned and how/what I've used them for. Sort of like my own stitching library.

Unsolved Issue
I kept getting an error when I was trying to connect my CSS. I think everything I've learned about styling must have leaked out my ears.
